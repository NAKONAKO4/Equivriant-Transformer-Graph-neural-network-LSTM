 This work is based on 'https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c00930'. So if you want to use my code please cite the article 'https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c00930' and a package release of this repo with 'https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c00930'
 
 Run the 'train.py' to see the results.
 
 Up to some benchmarks of 'https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c00930'.
 
 A more ROBUST big model is on the way!
